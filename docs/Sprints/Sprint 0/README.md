# Documentation (Milestone 1)

This is our project Documentation folder.
1. Minutes of all meetings, including Sprint Planning and Retro, plus logs of other communications 
2. User Stories + Acceptance Tests + Product Backlog if not in Trello board
3. Any architecture or design description you may want to provide (e.g., API design, microservice design) -- if you not at this point yet, you can just ignore this item.
